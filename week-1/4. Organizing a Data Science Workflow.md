**Overview:**

Data Science projects normally fit in as a part of a larger system. The actual code we write for our projects is only a small fraction with respect to the entire system, for instance, when creating a fake news classifier, the Machine Learning code is very small in comparison to to the other elements within the same system (i.e. Data Collection, Feature Extraction, Configuration, etc.). It is based on this that I tend to consider such projects as software projects.

Structure describes the predefined arrangement and organization of elements within the development of a Data Science project. It can be time consuming in the beginning but deciding to document and follow a structure is extremely useful for Data Science teams – it tends to pay dividends throughout the course of a project.

Data Science projects are often iterative in nature. Data Scientists engaged with rapid experimentation, visualization, and data analysis. Without a formal structure in place, returning to past analysis or projects can be challenging. Following a structured approach to projects will benefit:

- your future self, when you need to go back to your past work
    
- other team members, who will review your code or work on further iterations of your work
    
- new people on the team, who will be ramping up on the work your team delivers
    

**Proposed layout:**

Like Data Science workflows, there is no one size fits all when it comes to defining a structure to follow, but there are some key components that tend to recur in most projects. Once we’ve created our project directory, the first step is to separate code, data, notebooks, and models. Take a look at the image below for a better conceptual understanding.

Going forward, we will follow this structure to organize our codes and github repository.
