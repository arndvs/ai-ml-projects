# UBER ETA PREDICTION

## Background

Assume Uber is a food delivery company that was launched in 2022. The users can select a restaurant to order any of the following food items: snacks, drinks, meals, buffet. The delivery partner normally uses a bicycle, electric scooter, scooter, or motorcycle to deliver the order.

## Goal

Create an internal tool to estimate the time to deliver the food to the user, based on a set of given inputs. This will be used by other teams for enhancing driver experience, route optimization, capacity planning, etc.

## Outputs

- Build a machine learning model to predict the time taken to deliver the food.
- Deploy the application using Streamlit Community Cloud with an easy-to-use UI, where the time to deliver is calculated based on some user inputs.
- Ensure that the code is clean, well-organized, and document your findings (so your future self and other team members thank you).
